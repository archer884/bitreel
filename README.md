> A library to aid in downloading videos.

So far, this crate basically just allows you to query youtube for videos and available formats.

## Changelog

* **v0.2:** threw out entire interface. The hope is to eventually support facebook videos, at least, but as of now we still don't have a way to authenticate to facebook.
